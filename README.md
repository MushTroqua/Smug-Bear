# Smug-Bear
Smug bear is an all around discord bot built for a private discord server.

## Goals

* To effectively have one bot do everything rather than a combination of other bots.
* To have mynute control over features, and which to edit them to my own liking.

## Commands:
There isn't any features that aren't really that far off from any typical bot as of yet but here are the commands right now:

* **s!help** = Shows you the list of commands for Smug Bear!
* **s!ping** = Pong! Will give you the latency of the bot.
* **s!avatar** = Will get the url of your avatar and post it in the channel.

## Planned Features:

* **Minecraft server status checker** = Will check the status of a minecraft server to see if it's offline or online. Mainly only for players of my minecraft server.

* **Gambling commands** = Something like Lawliet's (A discord bot known for its gambling commands) gambling with an economy.

* **Reply to set phrases** = Intended to reply to frequently said words of users in my server. Think Dad Bot.

* **Moderator commands** = From commands such as s!ban and s!mute, among other things.

*This list will probably grow bigger once I get more creative/There are things which I can add that will make things more convenient for me*

## How to invite the bot to your own server?

As of right now, the only way you could use this bot is to host it using your own machine. You can host your own version of Smug bear by:

1. Create your own bot in Discord's developer portal
1. Cloning this repository
1. Open Command prompt by right-clicking on the cloned-repository 
1. Run npm i
1. After that, do node bot.js
1. Done!
