# Smug-Bear
Smug bear is an all around discord bot built for a private discord server.

## Goals

* To effectively have one bot do everything rather than a combination of other bots.
* To have mynute control over features, and which to edit them to my own liking.

## Commands:
There isn't any features that aren't really that far off from any typical bot as of yet but here are the commands right now:

* **s!ping** = Pong! Will give you the latency of the bot.
* **s!avatar** = Will get the url of your avatar and post it in the channel.

## Planned Features:

* **Help page** - Pretty obvious. When you do s!help, it will show the help page.

* **Minecraft server status checker** = Will check the status of a minecraft server to see if it's offline or online. Mainly only for players of my minecraft server.

* **Gambling commands** = Something like Lawliet's (A discord bot known for its gambling commands) gambling with an economy.

* **Reply to set phrases** = Intended to reply to frequently said words of users in my server. Think Dad Bot.

* **Moderator commands** = From commands such as s!ban and s!mute, among other things.

*This list will probably grow bigger once I get more creative/There are things which I can add that will make things more convenient for me*

## How to invite the bot to your own server?
