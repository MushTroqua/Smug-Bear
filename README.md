# Smug-Bear
Smug bear is an all around discord bot designed to accomodate for the wants and needs of my private discord server. There isn't any features that are notable as of yet but here are the commands right now:

* **s!ping** = Pong! Will give you the latency of the bot.
* **s!avatar** = Will get the url of your avatar and post it in the channel.

### Planned Features:

* **Minecraft server status checker** = Will check the status of a minecraft server to see if it's offline or online. Mainly only for players of my minecraft server.

* **Gambling commands** = Something like Lawliet's (A discord bot known for its gambling commands) gambling with an economy.

* **Reply to set phrases** = Intended to reply to frequently said words of the users in my server. Think Dad Bot.

* **Help page** - Pretty obvious. When you do s!help, it will show the help page...

#### How to invite the bot to your own server?

As of right now, the bot's invite link is hidden. This is to ensure that this stays a private bot for the foreseeable future. If ever the bot goes public, then so does the invite. You can host your own version of Smug bear by cloning the repository. If you have any concerns/messages, then you're free to message me at matsu#3622.
